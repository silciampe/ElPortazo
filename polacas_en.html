        <h3>Historical Context<br></br></h3> 
            <p> At the beginning of the 20th century, with the countless
                wave of immigration, Argentina doubles its
                number of inhabitants. Mixture of cultures,
                genres and languages ​​are going to found a new
                society.
                With the speech of "make it in America",
                rioted  in tenements with the
                hope of a prosperous future, those
                immigrants were willing to play
                any game.
                The merchant movement finds
                Argentina as one of the most
                hopeful. That potential
                prosperity, draws the attention of
                those who live from the skirmish. At that time, Rosario became the
                second biggest port of America after New York's one,                
                thus allowing the permanent influx
                of hundreds of thousands people who descend
                of merchant and passenger ships,
                turning it into the central axis of stowage,
                retail, gangsters, traffickers and white slavery. Traffic, clandestine gambling and
                covert prostitution, revolve around the
                main business of the largest port of
                Latin America.
                Policemen, cafishos and politicians buckets were filled at the expense of deceived young people who
                were brought from Europe, mainly from
                Poland, and ending
                at a very young age in unnamed burial niches,
                piled up and out of town, the
                prostitution becomes the
                most profitable business at the moment.</p>

        <h3>Synopsis</h3> 
            <p>The story is about Rachela, a young
                Jewish-Polish, who arrived in Rosario at the end of the
                decade of the '20. It was brought to Argentina with
                “the story of the boyfriend” by a mafia association, 
                the Zwi Migdal, to became a
                prostitute.
                It was delivered by a matchmaker in
                Poland, a woman who was dedicated to arrange
                Jewish marriages. The pimp who
                went to look for her, accepted, and she was just on the boat
                that brings her to Argentina when she
                understands the cruelty of her situation. Over there
                she meets Margot, who posed as the
                Schlomo's sister and is actually his
                lover.
                Margot pretends, not only inconditional love
                of Schlomo, but to become
                his partner, either as madam of the brothel or
                going to look for more women. Reality
                becomes unbearable for Rachela, but
                Schlomo rescues her. The daughter of the
                matchmaker, Ana, upon learning of the
                her mother's shenanigans is devoured by guilty. 
                In a fierce act of rebellion, she confronts her mother and sets out from
                Poland and emigrate to Argentina in
                to search for Rachela. To avoid the risks
                of the trip and end up being reduced by the
                same mafia against which she wanted to fight,
                decides to dress as a man. Ana cuts her
                long braids and leaves her hair short, she wraps
                her breasts and paints a few, little ridiculous, mustache hairs.
                She is ready for everything; load a trunk and
                leaves as a sailor. Takes with her the
                passport of a dead young Jewish. Once arrived in Rosario, Rachela is
                “tamed” by “select clients”
                to ensure docility. Margot
                reaches the place she craves within "the
                company”, becomes the manager of the brothel and
                Schlomo dedicats to “public relations” 
                with the regioanl police and politicians. Also, of course, he
                makes friends with the big capomafias of
                the area, Chicho Grande and Chicho Chico,
                although relations with them are
                tense. It is precisely thanks to them
                that Schlomo manages to solve the
                death of a "pupil" in
                criminal situations. Relationships
                come closer, but the tension will continue.
